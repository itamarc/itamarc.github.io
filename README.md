# Who I am

Someone that since a long time love technology. I learned to program with BASIC in 1985, when I was 12 years old and never stopped learning about everything related with computers, specially software. Now I have a BS in CS and a MSc in *Computer Forensic and Information Security* and I still love to learn new things.

## Jobs Data Dashboard

⚠️ This project is a work in progress!

My personal project to create a system with various technologies, just for knowledge. A job seeker system to grab data from several sources, compile them and shows it in graphical ways.

I'm using different technologies and tools in each part of this system, to be able to learn more.

There are some documentation of what I plan to build and some parts are already made.

So far, I used Python, MongoDB, a REST API, a Lambda Function made in Java and AWS SQS. The JDD Grabber runs in an AWS EC2 machine with Linux.
