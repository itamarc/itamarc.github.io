# Who I am

Someone that since a long time love technology. I learned to program with BASIC in 1985, when I was 12 years old and never stopped learning about everything related with computers, specially software. Now I have a BS in CS and a MSc in *Computer Forensic and Information Security* and I still love to learn new things.

Made with Java, Docker, some bash, git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The pages of my repositories are made with it, using the pre-build themes.

![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

I created a very simple [hangman game](https://github.com/itamarc/hangman) to show my daughters a little bit of what it's like to create a web app using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG.

While learning ReactJS, I re-created the Hangman game using it.

## Jobs Data Dashboard

A project to create a system with various technologies, just for knowledge. A job seeker system to grab data from several sources, compile them and shows it in graphical ways.

I used different technologies and tools in each part of this system, to be able to learn more.

There are some documentation of what I planed to build and some parts that are already made.

The documents were created using: ![Markdown](https://img.shields.io/badge/markdown-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=markdown&logoColor=white)

The diagrams were created with: ![Inkscape](https://img.shields.io/badge/Inkscape-e0e0e0?style=for-the-badge&logo=inkscape&logoColor=080A13)

I used Python, MongoDB, a REST API, a Lambda Function made in Java and AWS SQS. The JDD Grabber runs in an AWS EC2 machine with Linux.

⚠️ I stopped this project because of the difficulty to find open and free jobs APIs.

You can check the docs repository at:
- [https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/](https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/)

(See the [README](https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/README.html) for details about the project)

### JDD LogFunc
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
![AWS Lambda](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS_Lambda-%23F27A13.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

This is a AWS Lambda Function made in Java to receive the log messages through a AWS SQS messages queue and insert them into a MongoDB collection.

The idea was to centralize in it log messages comming from all other components in the system.

This component is up and running.

Specific docs:
- [https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/doc/Logging.html](https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/doc/Logging.html)

Source code repository:
- [https://github.com/itamarc/JobsDataDashboard-jddlogfunc](https://github.com/itamarc/JobsDataDashboard-jddlogfunc)

### JDD Grabber
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

This is a component made in Python to grab data from jobs online services using their APIs.

The Grabber saves the grabbed data into a MongoDB collection and used JDD LogFunc to save the logging messages, putting them in the SQS queue.

This component is completed, but only grabs data from one source.
