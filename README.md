# Who I am

Someone that since a long time love technology. I learned to program with BASIC in 1985, when I was 12 years old and never stopped learning about everything related with computers, specially software. Now I have a BS in CS and a MSc in *Computer Forensic and Information Security* and I still love to learn new things.

It's a very simple hangman game I created to show my daughters a little bit of what it's like to create a web app.

It uses only HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SVG.

## Jobs Data Dashboard

⚠️ This project is a work in progress! ⚠️

My personal project to create a system with various technologies, just for knowledge. A job seeker system to grab data from several sources, compile them and shows it in graphical ways.

I'm using different technologies and tools in each part of this system, to be able to learn more.

There are some documentation of what I plan to build and some parts are already made.

The documents were created using: ![Markdown](https://img.shields.io/badge/markdown-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=markdown&logoColor=white)

The diagrams were created with: ![Inkscape](https://img.shields.io/badge/Inkscape-e0e0e0?style=for-the-badge&logo=inkscape&logoColor=080A13)

So far, I used Python, MongoDB, a REST API, a Lambda Function made in Java and AWS SQS. The JDD Grabber runs in an AWS EC2 machine with Linux.

You can check the docs repository at:
- [https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/](https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/)

(See the [README](https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/README.html) for details about the project)

### JDD LogFunc
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)
![AWS Lambda](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS_Lambda-%23F27A13.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

This is a AWS Lambda Function made in Java to receive the log messages through a AWS SQS messages queue and insert them into a MongoDB collection.

The idea was to centralize in it log messages comming from all other components in the system.

Specific docs:
- [https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/doc/Logging.html](https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/doc/Logging.html)

Source code repository:
- [https://github.com/itamarc/JobsDataDashboard-jddlogfunc](https://github.com/itamarc/JobsDataDashboard-jddlogfunc)

### JDD Grabber
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)

This is a component made in Python to grab data from jobs online services using their APIs.

The Grabber saves the grabbed data into a MongoDB collection and used JDD LogFunc to save the logging messages, putting them in the SQS queue.

Specific docs:
- [https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/doc/GrabberJob.html](https://itamarc.github.io/JobsDataDashboard/doc/GrabberJob.html)
